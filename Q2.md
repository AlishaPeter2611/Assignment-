An ATM, or Automated Teller Machine, allows you to access your bank account funds with no need to visit a bank teller. This is a detailed breakdown to help you navigate using an ATM independently:




 Inquire your bank about accessibility features for ATMs. These may include:

* **Braille cards**: Raised dots representing your bank's name for card identification.

*  **Tactile features**: Notches or raised markings on the card to indicate insertion orientation.

 * **Talking ATMs**: ATMs with voice guidance that walk you through each step.

* **Headphone jack**: Allows for private voice guidance.


Locate an accessible ATM. Many banks have a branch locator tool that allows you to filter for ATMs with accessibility features.


How to use an ATM :


1. Have your ATM card and PIN (Personal Identification Number) readily available. Never share your PIN with anyone.
You should use voice guidance or tones for PIN entry to maintain privacy. 

2. Locate the ATM slot. Many ATMs have an audio or braille prompt indicating the slot location. Feel for the notch or raised marking on your card. This side should face you when inserting.
 Insert the card carefully, listening for voice prompts or feeling for a slight resistance when fully inserted.

3. Look for the raised buttons to navigate and select options according to the voice prompts.
The ATM might offer an option for discreet PIN entry.   

  * If no discreet option is available, use the keypad and shield your hand while entering your PIN.

 4. Voice prompts will guide you through tasks like withdrawals, balance checks, or transfers.
Listen for prompts indicating your card is ready for retrieval. Carefully remove it.

5. The ATM might ask if you want a receipt. Follow prompts for dispensing the receipt.


* These instructions should be provided to the visually impaired individuals in audio format who don't use Braille.
